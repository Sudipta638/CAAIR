    desc: " Summary:On 14th March, 2020, the very distinguished alumni of NIT Durgapur, Mr. Sabas Fernando, General Manager and Mr. Piyush Saurabh, Sr. Manager of TATA Motors, Jamshedpur helped everyone with their wonderful speeches and interactive sessions on Automotive Industry and the challenges and opportunities faced by it. As one of the guests started talking about ‘an engineer’s mindset’, the discussion also went on the statement that “before properly figuring out what to do in life, Indians tend to become an engineer. Talking about the opportunities, there are many which included automobile designer, manufacturer, internet marketing, salesperson, and so on. However, they also mentioned that there may not be a desirable campus placement scenario since the company is not growing as per expectations. The above scopes and opportunities in the lecture was followed by an interactive session on the challenges faced by the industry, where it was mentioned how they have to face the pressure imposed by environmental, customer demands and competitive pressures on cost, quality, performance and manufacturability of the vehicles. The industry also has to face issues regarding fuel economy, gas emissions, safety and affordability. Thus they concluded the speech with a positive note encouraging the students to work hard and believe in themselves in order to achieve excellence.",
